This portfolio was created using NextJS and shows Styled-jsx (with SCSS) working for components written in TypeScript rendered both inside and outside of Storybook.

## How to use
```bash
yarn dev
```

### Run Storybook

```bash
yarn storybook
```

### Build Static Storybook

```bash
yarn build-storybook
```

You can use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) to deploy Storybook. Specify `storybook-static` as the output directory.

## Notes
